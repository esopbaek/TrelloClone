# Trello Lite

Lightweight backbone.js application which mimics Trello functionality. Users can create boards, lists, and cards to organize their life online. Incorporates the jQuery Sortable widget, which allows users to move cards between lists such as when moving a card from a "todo" list to a "completed tasks" list.

**Todo:**
 *Modal views for cards, and for double-checking when users delete boards, lists, and/or cards
 *server-side ordering errors when dragging card elements to a new order
 *style pages with more consistency
